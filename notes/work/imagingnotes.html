Laptops will follow the diagram above during their imaging procedure. The following is just a rough overview. Find the individual section for more information on each part

1. A new/old laptop that needs to be imaged will be booted into a macOS High Sierra or newer (HFS+ if not already APFS). From there a macOS installer should be set to install onto the target drive.
2. After being imaged the laptop will reboot, install firmware, and begin Setup Assistant. After choosing a language, keyboard type and wireless network, a DEP Configuration pane should appear. This will enroll the laptop into JSS.
3. After enrollment, logging into the laptop with tech will begin the "Policy Cascade". This will begin by reconing the device and going through each step. The first step involves user-intervention for inputting a name for the device. This can be customized for each type of device and allows for easy input and accurate error correction.
4. With a correct name, the laptop will begin to bind itself to AD. Because of macOS and AD rules, the full computer name **MUST** be less than 15 characters and the name is automatically all lowercase, regardless of case.
5. After AD Binding, the laptop is now completely configured for our infrastructure and now can enter into customizable policies. This is where we enter free reign for how we want these devices configured

The main parts with this new DEP imaging path is that every laptop **MUST** be AD Bound (security and ease-of-use reasons) and that the name **MUST** be correct prior to AD Binding.

Goals
-------------
The two main goals with the new imaging procedure are **Modularity** and **Flexibility**

The process is modular in the sense that it:

1. Can be tweaked either in small parts or completely and still retain the shape from the diagram above.
2. Can be expanded upon easily

The process is also flexible as it can:

1. Accept most new additions easily.
2. Change easily with how Apple chooses to allow their devices to be imaged.

Together these two _should_ allow for this to be relatively future proof, in the sense that the main concept and paths taken should be compatible for the next major macOS updates.


!!! note Note
    Please read this **ENTIRE** document prior to going through with imaging a laptop. Some of it is not necessarily out of order, but happens concurrently and needs to be setup at the same time/prior to the other steps.

    This document just follows the chart above, of which it follows a single device through all of the stages of imaging, and not necessarily the same steps needed for setup.

Imaging
=================

USB Drive Preparation
-------------
All imaging is done via an external USB drive running macOS. The following must be met for the process to work

+ If going from HFS+ to APFS on a device that never has had APFS, you must have:
    1. 10.13.3 or higher
    2. HFS+ (**NOT APFS**)
    3. The newest macOS installer (the full installer, not the 50MB stub)

+ If going from APFS to APFS (device currently has APFS), you must have:
    1. 10.13.3 or higher
    2. APFS **OR** HFS+
    3. The newest macOS installer (the full installer, not the 50MB stub)

To setup the USB Drive you must do the following:

!!! note **Note**
    If there are any padlocks in System Preferences that need to be unlocked, it is expected (read: unwritten) for you to unlock them.



+ On an **APFS** formatted macOS 10.13.3 or above device:
    1. Install the newest full macOS installer.
    2. In terminal, run:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
        $ sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ [NAME OF MACOS].app/Content/Resources/startosinstall \
                --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ [NAME OF MACOS].app \
                --agreetolicense \
                --nointeraction \
                --converttoapfs NO \
                --volume /Volumes/[USB DRIVE NAME]
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
        (The '\' are just line breaks, for readability. You can just leave them)

        This will slowly count up to 100% then reboot repeatedly. It will completely install a fresh copy of macOS onto the target drive. It also makes sure to _not_ convert to apfs, as the to-be imaged laptops can not detect APFS volumes.
    3. Go through Setup Assistant and **DO NOT** go through DEP/Configuration. This is to keep the USB imager out of JSS.
    4. Create the tech account, with the standard password
    5. Log into tech and proceed to copy the macOS installer from the laptop you imaged the USB with (it should have it) into /Applications/
    6. Open System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options and click 'Join' next to Network Account Server. Click 'Open Directory Utility' then go to Edit > Enable Root User. Hit enter twice on the dialog (as in no password). This will enable the root user with no password for easy logging in with admin privledges.
    7. Log out of tech then login to root (no password). Go into Users & Groups, then add the macOS Installer that you copied earlier into startup items for 'System Administrator' (root). You can also add Disk Utility here if you don't have a script made to automatically wipe the SSD on login. (I didn't make one)
    8. Also in Users & Groups > Login Options, Set Login Window to be Name & Password. This is kinda nice as it means you can login even faster (no profile bubbles to click into).

!!! tip **Disabling External Accounts**
    + This will remove the dialog on boot to allow an external account (ie one not from the USB drive) to access files on the current device. With sometimes over 30+ accounts this takes awhile to remove the dialog
    + If this USB is going to be used enmass on already-in-use devices with network accounts (see: nearly every student device) this is a 100% necessary step. If not, then skip this.
    + These steps are expecting you to be on the USB drive, but the bulk of them can be done on another device and carried over by another USB drive.



    1. Log into JSS and enter into Computers > Configuration Profiles. In there you will find a profile named "Disable External Accounts" (it might be under AJH - First Boot or something like that). Enter into the profile and click download.
    2. The System Preferences window _might_ see this profile and immediately prompt you to install it, but if it doesn't just click on it and follow the dialogs to install it. It will be unverified, but that is because the USB drive lacks the Root Cert for the JSS Built-In Cert Authority (not a big deal, this isn't being used by a end user)

After the drive is setup, reboot and login to root with no password and verify that the following work/exist:

1. root with no password works 
2. Install macOS automatically opens
3. (optional) Disk Utility automatically opens
4. (optional) External Profiles are disabled (check the profile exists)


On-Site Imaging
------------

With a to-be imaged device on hand, just like how it was tested, boot into the macOS USB drive. After booting in, complete the following steps, in order:

1. Open/Click on Disk Utility and hit Command(⌘)+2 (or go into View > Show all devices). Select the SSD for the device you would like to image, not the volume. It should be named something like Apple SSD.
2. Format the volume and make sure it is **HFS+** and **GUID Partition Map**. This ensures that the macOS Installer will format the drive over to APFS during the installation (it can be flaky with it already APFS for some reason)
3. After the drive is erased, begin the macOS installer and make sure it is pointed at the internal SSD not the USB drive. You may need to hit 'Show all devices' during the prompt.
4. The computer should now begin imaging. For instructions on what to do after it reaches Setup Assistant, go onto DEP Enrollment.


!!! note Troubleshooting
    If you run into problems with the install failing for unknown reasons (goes to recovery with a restart button or something of the sort) try the following:
        + Do what Apple tells you to do and just restart. It should pick back up into the install process and it _might_ make it past the part it got stuck on. I've had this work once for no real reason. Just try it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        + Re-image it with the flash drive. This one rarely works, as the issue probably will persist with the same hardware. Still try it, and also throw in a SSD format/wipe to try.
        + Grab/make another USB drive. Honestly this one is the only one that has consistently worked. Some of the drives for some reason refuse to work on some laptops. No real idea why, just that this is the #1 fix I have found.


DEP Enrollment
=================

Device Enrollment Protocol (DEP)
----------
Apple's solution to laptop setup (whether that be imaging or not) is the Device Enrollment Protocol. This is just a fancy name for a tiny payload that can be forced on a laptop during Setup Assistant. Not much can be done with DEP (at least through JSS) but what it does allow is for us to enroll devices into JSS instantly after boot.

The positives of DEP:
+ Apple supports it
+ It isn't scripted (all GUI based in JSS)
+ Automatic: 
    + Profile creation (ie tech or teachers, if we decided to do that)
    + User Approved Mobile Device Management Profiles (see UAMDM)

The negatives of DEP:
+ For it to be worth it, the laptop must be imaged, or a fresh unbox
+ For what Apple plays it up to be, it honestly does not do that much. There is very little ability to do arbitrary commands/installations/policies off of it. This means that the overwhelming majority of the "imaging" is just policy cascading through specific smart grouping.
+ Depending on your PoV, the lack of scripting is a nightmare
+ It is slow
+ Overly dependent on external servers (DEP is 100% external, minus the setup to JSS)
+ JSS seems to be lacking some of the abilities that DEP has (that being computer naming prior to enrollment)

DEP works through [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) (previously known as dep.apple.com) where a device is enrolled via serial number. For iPads this gives us both Supervision and Management over the device. For MacBooks, all we get is just a list of the devices we own, and a tie into the Setup Assistant. This list of devices is then hooked up to our local JSS server via a token, which allows JSS to pull all of the devices into a 'PreStage Enrollment'. 

### PreStage Enrollment

**PreStage Enrollments** are what allow us to select specific devices and place them into a group to be enrolled after being picked up by DEP during Setup. There are also a few other settings that are modifiable, like AD Binding, Local Users, Purchasing Info, and a few others. No option allows for an arbitrary script to be run after it finishes though, leaving us with a bit of a problem when it comes to automating the entire imaging process. To put it simply, PreStage Enrollments are just JAMF's implementation of the client side part of DEP. Nothing special exists with it. If Apple decides to give or remove the ability to do something then JAMF is at their will. Because of the lack of scripting and command input, we have to use what is called (or I call) Policy Cascading. See Naming for more info on this.

To say that DEP is woefully underwhelming is an understatement. For what it's worth, DEP is a solution to a problem, and that's about it. Its not pretty nor is it fast, but it (sometimes) works and until Apple creates another solution for imaging/setup, we're stuck with it.



User Approved Mobile Device Management (UAMDM)
----------

User Approved Mobile Device Management (UAMDM) is Apple's new form of MDM profile, that is given more permissions than a standard profile. Currently (as of 10.13.6) UAMDM profiles give you the ability to apply Kernel Extensions (kexts) to a device. They do not have any other permissions that are different from a standard MDM profile. They were introduced into macOS in 10.13.3.

To get a UAMDM profile you must do one of the following:
+ Enroll a device through DEP, whether it be before or after imaging (profiles -N)
+ Be grandfathered into it by upgrading from 10.13.2 or below to 10.13.3 or higher.
+ Manually approve the profile by opening profiles in System Preferences and clicking approve.

While UAMDM profiles may seem kinda useless for our infrastructure currently, as we do not use any kexts, Apple did announce during WWDC 2018 that testing applications can soon require that an MDM profile be User Approved for them to accept the testing environment. Since we plan on using almost all of our devices for testing, we need to make sure that any imaging or repairs we do to a laptop leave it with a UAMDM profile. JSS has the ability to detect when a profile is not User Approved, and we can scope to that to check that every laptop has the correct profile.


The best explanation for UAMDM that I have read would be a problem that Apple created where its only real solution is DEP.

Setup
------------

Setting up DEP is sometimes easy and other times an absolute nightmare. JAMF's implementation of the MDM side of DEP is definitely buggy and has its issues, so you will need to probably fight through them.

To go from nothing to a working PreStage Enrollment do the following:
1. Start by going to JSS > Computers > PreStage Enrollments and create a new PreStage.
2. Give it a reasonable name (you will need it later)
3. Fill out the settings as they are listed below.

**General**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Automatically assign new devices: No (unless this is actually needed)
DEP Instance: Amherst Mobile Devices
Support Phone #: Anything
Department: Anything
Make MDM Profile Mandatory: No
Allow MDM Profile Removal: Yes
Setup Assistant: All Selected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Account Settings**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Account Username: tech
Create an additional admin account: No
Local User Account Type: Skip Account Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

**User and Location**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Department: Whatever the dept. is
Building: Whatever the building is
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

!!! ERROR Directory Settings
    **DO NOT** setup the Directory settings in the PreStage. Doing so will bind the device prior to being named correctly, meaning they are going to just be garbage in AD. AD Binding is done later through a policy.

### Adding Devices to PreStage Enrollment Scope

Adding devices to the scope is the point where it gets really buggy. Adding one or two devices seems to always work fine, but adding a ton (by hitting the checkbox header) usually fails. 

Devices can be added semi-easily by just going to the PreStage Enrollment you made > Scope > Edit, then search by Name, or Serial Number. Adding one or two or manually adding a bunch is relatively safe, but hitting the checkbox to select all from the current view usually breaks after it is saved. I'd recommend contacting JAMF about this, it seems like a really stupid bug that shouldn't happen.

Try one of the following to get it to work:
1. Sometimes, making the view count (down by the page number) say All makes the checkbox header work.
2. Refresh the DEP instance, by hitting refresh in the bottom bar
3. Re-add the DEP token by doing the following:
    1. Grab a new public key from JSS by going to Settings > Device Enrollment Program > Public Key (top corner)
    2. Log into [Apple School](https://school.apple.com), go to MDM Server > jss.amherstk12.org > Upload Key and upload the key you just downloaded 
    3. Hit Get Token to download another token but this time from Apple School
    3. Go back into the JSS DEP Settings and click into Amherst Mobile Devices instance. Edit it and upload the server token file from Apple School
4. Try again later. This has worked once or twice.

!!! tip DEP Connection Errors in JSS
    If JSS keeps saying "Unable to contact https://mdmenrollment.apple.com" you might be able to just ignore that. If it refuses to update, try the DEP Token instructions above. If it still is there, call JAMF, I have no idea why that doesn't go away

!!! tip Device fails to Assign to PreStage
    If a device continues to fail to assign to a PreStage, try unassigning the device from [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) and re-assign it:
        1. Log into [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) using at least a Site Manager account. Go to Device Assignments
        2. Enter the serial number for the device into the 1st field then select unassign devices in the drop down box in the 2nd field.
        3. In JSS go to Settings > Device Enrollment Program > [Name of Program] > Devices and hit refresh.
        4. Double check that the Computer does not exist in the list when you search by S/N
        5. Go back into [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) and make sure the same S/N is in the 1st field, then select Assign to Server in the dropdown. Select https://jss.amherstk12.org for the server.
        6. In JSS, continually refresh until you see the device again. Try reassigning it, it should work now.

You will know if a device is correctly setup for DEP if it shows as Assigned in [PreStage Enrollment Name] > Scope.

On-Site DEP Configuration
-----------
DEP does not play a part in the laptop imaging process until we get to Setup Assistant. DEP configuration takes hold here after the Network is joined. A Configuration Profile screen with a cog will show up. Click continue on it and watch for if the spinning wheel skips. If it does, then you know it is working. If it keeps spinning forever, then something is wrong with the laptop/DEP PreStage. I'd recommend re-imaging the laptop if this happens, or if it continues after a re-image, find what is broken with your PreStage Enrollment. Not much is configurable with DEP at the laptop, as almost all of it happens in the backend. It basically either works or it doesn't, really nothing else can happen.

!!! tip No Configuration Profile Pane (DEP) during Setup Assistant
    + If you get to after the Network setup and there isn't a Configuration Profile (DEP) pane and just the Data & Privacy pane, go all the way back to the beginning of Setup Assistant and try again, including Network again (act as if you've never gone through Setup Assistant at this point). This most of the time will force the laptop to check for DEP again, and assuming it is actually scoped to the PreStage Enrollment, it will show the Configuration Profile (DEP) pane. 
    + If you keep trying and still can not see the Configuration Profiles pane, you will have to reimage the device. See [Quick Imaging](#toc7.1) for more info on doing this.

Naming
=================

For AD Binding to be organized, the name must be sanitized _prior_ to binding. This means that the most important step of this process is the naming of the laptop, and because of this, the bulk of the customized scripting was spent here.

Device names **MUST** be less than 15 characters in total length for AD binding and also are automatically changed to all lowercase during binding.

Scripts
------------

All of the scripts that are necessary can be found in JSS under Settings > Computer Management > Scripts. The two scripts that handle the naming are 'Change Computer Name Dialog' and 'Change Computer Name Dialog Lab'. The non-lab script is built for any device not used by multiple people (ie Teachers or just one of devices). This means that the name is **NOT** sanitized (besides length) and is also the least configurable.

The lab version of the script is built for any device used by many people (through AD logins). This specifically means that through some configuration on the policy, the script can ask for the building name, cart number, and computer number all at the device. The building name can even be specified prior to imaging, in the policy, as most likely every device imaged is going to be at the same building. Cart Number and Computer Number can have bounds for a maximum number, also set in the policy.

The lab version of the script has the following arguments:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Building Name: Short Name of the building. Example: Steele, AJH, Nord. Defaults to asking at the device
# Of Carts: Maximum number of carts. Provides sanitiation at the device. Defaults to 100
# Of Computers: Maximum number of computers per cart. Provides sanitiation at the device. Defaults to 100
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name dialog is presented via embedded AppleScript inside of a Bash script. The scripts have been formatted such that the AppleScript is as readable as possible, and also easily configurable, for whatever future changes may be needed. Any command that has `osascript -e` in it is executing AppleScript. Currently only for the lab verison, there is also a dialog after the name is entered for the user to confirm that the name is correct, and if it is incorrect, it allows the user to easily re-do the name prior to saving. This should prevent fat-fingering the name.


AD Binding
=================

AD Binding is currently the 2nd to last step in the process. It _always_ happens after the naming happens. This ensures the name is correct prior to being bound, as without it, there would be a bunch of garbage in AD. A computer is bound using the JSS built-in directly binding policy. In JSS, we currently have two AD Binding "profiles", one with and one without AMH_Staff_G as local Administrators. Which one is applied depends on the use case.

Directory Binding status can be found in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options. If the computer is bound, a green circle with AMHERSTK12 will be there, and if not, it will display Network Server with a Join button.

Device names **MUST** be less than 15 characters in total length and also are automatically changed to all lowercase during binding.


Policies
=================

Any misc policies that need to be run can be done in the last smart group. **DO NOT** put them in any other smart group other than the last, as you can not be certain if they will be done in order. (basically you can't be certain if the policy will run before or after the policy that changes the imaging step, and therefore the smart group)

!!! tip Categories
    Please try to use categories when making imaging policies or profiles. They are so extremely nice for ordering things.

Misc
=================

Just various things that I thought were important to know but had no place to go elsewhere in the documentation.

Quick Imaging
------------
If you have spent any time actually imaging theses laptops using this method, you will know that the bulk of the time spent is actually the absurdly long macOS install process. To make the process faster, we can exploit a utility called [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases), which will complete the installation for us once and install it into a DMG file (aptly named). Using the DMG, we can restore the computer with Disk Utility (CLI version) and bypass the entire macOS install process. This procedure is extremely helpful for devices that make it to the Setup Assistant but end up failing for various reasons, and need reimaging.

!!! WARNING APFS ONLY
    The device **MUST** have already been imaged from < 10.13 to > 10.13 with the macOS Installer. This is due to firmware limitations, as 10.13 added support for APFS.

### AutoDMG Setup

On a Mac with the newest versions of macOS, macOS installer and [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) installed:

1. Open [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/releases) then drag your macOS installer onto the dialog.
2. Click Apply Updates, and Download. This will pull and misc updates for macOS required apps (iTunes and the likes)
3. In the additional software field, unless you have a package you need to install on the device, leave this blank. It is directly against the philosophy of our imaging process, so try not to use it.
4. Click build in the bottom after the Downloads are done. Chose a location to put it, then leave you laptop alone for awhile. The process can take up to 2 hours.
5. After it is complete, I recommend making sure it is named how you want it (preferably OS version, date and any special things about it).

### Flash Drive Setup

To create a flash drive that can be used to quickly image devices you must do all of the steps needed to [normally create a USB imaging flash drive](#toc2.1), but at step 8 continue from here (and do the external accounts fix).

1. Create a folder named Configurations on the root (use / not /var/root) of the drive. Copy the AutoDMG DMG you made earlier into this folder
2. On the home folder for root (/var/root) create a file named depimage.sh or quickimage.sh, whatever you want. 
3. In this file (using Text Editor, vim, nano, or whatever you have) paste the following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
# Check for presence of Core Storage logical volume, and remove if found.
if [[ ${csvolumes} != "No CoreStorage logical volume groups found" ]]; then
    echo "Core storage volume found."
    diskutil cs deleteVolume disk1
fi

# Restore AFPS Image to internal container from /Configurations
asr restore -s /Configurations/*.dmg -t /dev/disk0s2 -erase -noverify -noprompt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This script is configured specifically for the scenario of a USB booted MacBook with one internal drive. I **HIGHLY** recommend testing this in an environment that is okay with being erased accidentally. There is a very good chance that this script could hit the wrong device if used wrong.

4. Enter the following command to allow the file to be executable:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
# chmod +x ./[Name of File]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. I recommend setting terminal to automatically open on login.

### On-Site Use

Once on site and you happen upon a laptop that for some reason has failed to correctly DEP or now has the wrong name or some other reason to where it may need to be imaged, boot the laptop to the new USB "Fixer" Flash Drive.

If you followed the setup from above, the following steps should be very simple:

1. Login with root and no password
2. If it is not set to automatically open, open terminal.
3. Type `./depimage.sh` (or whatever you called the script) and hit enter. The device should begin imaging. The `./` is important, as that tells bash to check your current directory. It will wipe the drive then begin restoring.
4. After it is done (it will be done soon after it starts Inverting the volume), reboot to the main SSD in the laptop.
5. Continue on through Setup Assistant as you did before


Policy Cascading
------------

To get around the issue of DEP/PreStage not having any ability to execute policies, we can use what I call Policy Cascading. This process is pretty self explanatory just based on the name, but as simple description of it is having policies and smart groups control the order of policy execution.

The general process behind a policy cascade is the following:

1. Computer is enrolled and enters the beginning smart group
2. The policy to begin the cascade is run on login or enrollment.
    + This policy simply runs `jamf recon` and `jamf policy` over the number of stages there are (ie 3 stages, 3 recon/policies).
3. The computer is recon'd by the cascade, then the first policy is executed.
    + This policy ends with an external file change that an extension attribute is continually checking on recon.
4. The computer is recon'd again by the cascade, with the next policy in order executing afterwards.
5. Steps 3-4 are executed as many times as there are stages. This is determined by the length of the policy cascade.
6. The policy in the last stage changes the external file to reflect the important policies being complete. With this, the laptop enters the final smart group containing all of the Configuration Profiles and unimportant policies.

### Smart Groups

One of the most important parts of this process is having the Smart Groups correctly setup. This means that they should never allow a computer to go out of order, leave early, or enter the incorrect group. To group the computers correctly, we have two different major differentiators, the DEP Enrollment Scope and the Imaging Step Extension Attribute. The first being a imaging process differentiator and the second being a step seperator. For more information on how the Imaging Step Extension Attribute works, see the section [below](#toc7.2.2).

The following below is an example of what the criteria of a few cascaded smart groups would look like:

**Naming Smart Group**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: None
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**AD Binding Smart Group**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: 1 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Important Policies Smart Group**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: 2 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Final Smart Group**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: Complete 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this setup, it should be nearly impossible for a computer to exist in more than one of these smart groups. It also means that if the policies are setup correctly, they should also only go through the smart groups in order, starting with Imaging Step: None.

!!! Warning Smart Group Responsibility
    The only smart groups that should be doing more than one policy are the first and last groups. The first group runs the policy cascade and the naming policies and the last group pushes any unimportant policies onto the laptop and also the profiles. Every other smart group relies on policy ordering, and as such, can not do more than one job. Essentially since JSS has no way of ordering policies, we can not put the computer naming and AD binding policies in the same smart group. This could cause the AD binding policy to run prior to the naming policy, which is exactly the opposite of what we want.

### Imaging Step Extension Attribute

The Imaging Step Extension Attribute is a custom inventory record created to keep track of where a computer is during its imaging process. Originally I had used names to differentiate between steps, but after realizing that JSS loves to randomly drop computer names and revert to old names, I decided to roll my own scheme. 

The extension attribute reads from a file found in the organizational directory (`/usr/local/amh`) named imagingstep. This file is created on recon if it is not found. The script 'Iterate Imaging Step' is used at the end of policies that require the computer to leave one group and enter another. This script will take what is currently in the imagingstep file and iterate it by one. If the file is empty, it writes the number one. The final policy will use 'Change Imaging Step to Complete' to change the imagingstep file to read 'Complete'. This will put the computer into the final smart group and ensure it does not go any further.

Full Example
=================

In this section, I will use the **AJH MacBook Airs** as an example of the imaging process, and go through the full configuration.

PreStage Enrollment
------------

**General**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Name: AJH MacBook Airs
Automatically assign new devices: No (unless this is actually needed)
DEP Instance: Amherst Mobile Devices
Support Phone #: Tech #
Department: Tech 
Make MDM Profile Mandatory: No
Allow MDM Profile Removal: Yes
Setup Assistant: All Selected

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Account Settings**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Account Username: tech
Create an additional admin account: No
Local User Account Type: Skip Account Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

**User and Location**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Department: Tech
Building: AJH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Computer Smart Groups
------------

**AJH - Naming Imaging (i.1)**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: None
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**AJH - AD Binding (i.2)**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: 1 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**AJH - MacBook Airs (i.3)**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
DEP PreStage Enrollment: AJH MacBook Airs
Imaging Step: Complete 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Naming Policy
------------

Using the Lab version of the dialog

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ text
Building Name: AJH
Max # Of Carts: 13
Max # Of Computers: 30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The naming policy is scoped to the **AJH - Naming Imaging (i.1)** smart group.

The naming policy finishes with 'Iterate Imaging Step' (imagingstep would be 1 after)

AD Binding
------------

Using the AD Binding w/ Teachers 'AD profile'

The AD binding policy is scoped to the **AJH - AD Binding (i.2)** smart group.

The AD binding policy finishes with 'Change Imaging Step to Complete' (imagingstep would be 'Complete' after)

Finishing Policies
------------

Install Google Chrome is the only policy set to run after everything is complete.

All finishing policies are scoped to the **AJH - MacBook Airs (i.3)** smart group. 

Known Issues
=================

(###) No Confirm Dialog for non-lab Naming Script

Haven't gotten around to adding this.

(###) Naming dialog appears more than once.

This is the weirdest bug out of all of these. No real reason why this happens, and it seems to go away when you change a small part of the policy.

(###) Chrome fails to install (policy fails)

This has to do with the curl command timing out after 5 minutes. This could happen either because too many devices are downloading Chrome at once, causing them all to slow down, or that when the Wireless profile is installed, the curl command fails to restart the download. Besides adding a whole lot of checking to the script, the only solution is to separate Chrome from the profiles and give it its own Smart Group. This is overly complicated for just Google Chrome, so I have not done it yet. For the time being, just flush the log and run `sudo jamf policy` in terminal to fix this.

(###) DEP Connection Errors in JSS

You might be able to ignore this. I have not found a real reason for these, nor can I find a solution for them. I'd recommend calling JAMF about these.

(###) Device fails to Assign to PreStage

If a device continues to fail to assign to a PreStage, try unassigning the device from [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) and re-assign it:
    1. Log into [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) using at least a Site Manager account. Go to Device Assignments
    2. Enter the serial number for the device into the 1st field then select unassign devices in the drop down box in the 2nd field.
    3. In JSS go to Settings > Device Enrollment Program > [Name of Program] > Devices and hit refresh.
    4. Double check that the Computer does not exist in the list when you search by S/N
    5. Go back into [Apple School](https://school.apple.com) and make sure the same S/N is in the 1st field, then select Assign to Server in the dropdown. Select https://jss.amherstk12.org for the server.
    6. In JSS, continually refresh until you see the device again. Try reassigning it, it should work now.

(###) A policy is running before another and causing an issue

This is an inherent limitation with JSS. You can not mandate an order for policies from the same smart group. Because of this, the only way to have a policy to run before another is to separate them into different smart groups. This is what the policy cascading is for. If a policy is important enough to where it must be run before another policy, make another stage in the Policy Cascading. See the [section on this](#toc7.2) for more information.

(###) No Configuration Profile Pane (DEP) during Setup Assistant

+ If you get to after the Network setup and there isn't a Configuration Profile (DEP) pane and just the Data & Privacy pane, go all the way back to the beginning of Setup Assistant and try again, including Network again (act as if you've never gone through Setup Assistant at this point). This most of the time will force the laptop to check for DEP again, and assuming it is actually scoped to the PreStage Enrollment, it will show the Configuration Profile (DEP) pane. 
+ If you keep trying and still can not see the Configuration Profiles pane, you will have to reimage the device. See [Quick Imaging](#toc7.1) for more info on doing this.
